CHANGELOG FOR OLDER UPDATES WAS NOT RECORDED

version 1 was created on 25th October 2019 and was a code of just 125 lines!
It did not have any graphical Tanks in it but only attack buttons and messages of damage taken were printed on screen.
version 2 took a step ahead by not being dependent on python shell but everything taking place in one window.
The progress was very quick at that time with new grand updates every now and then.
version 3 was the first update to feature health bars but it wasn't until on October 28th that graphical tanks were added to the game with the release of version 4.
version 4 not only added graphic to the game, but also was the first update to support a database for user statistics and cheat codes.
